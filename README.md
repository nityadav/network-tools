# network-tools
This repository contains a set of tools in python and matlab to work with networks. These tools were created by me during my thesis work on "Community-affinity: measuring strength of memberships of nodes in network communities". My thesis can be found [here](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~nityadav/thesis). Feel free to use any code and give me any suggestions that you have :)
